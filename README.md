# nonochill
Nonogram game implementation using Vue.

Created to check out how Vue is used, and also because I really like nonograms.

Check it out [here](https://jzumun.github.io/nonochill/)

**UPDATE**: Version 2, rewritten using single file components, can be seen [here](https://github.com/JZumun/nonochill-v2)

## What's a Nonogram?
[Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) according to wikipedia are “picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.” More details, as well as some tips on solving nonograms, can be found on that link.

## Issues
The puzzles here are randomly generated, so the picture they create don’t depict anything. 
It is possible that a puzzle generated by this code has more than one solution
